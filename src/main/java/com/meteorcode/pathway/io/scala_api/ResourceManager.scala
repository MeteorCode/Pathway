/**
 * A ResourceManager "fuses" a directory or directories into a virtual filesystem, abstracting Zip and Jar archives
 * as though they were directories.
 *
 * Root directories and archives archives are attached at `/` in the virtual filesystem, and directories within archives
 * are "fused" into one directory in the virtual filesystem. For example, if we have a file `foo.zip` containing the
 * path `foo/images/spam.png` and a directory `bar` containing `bar/images/eggs.jpeg`, the virtual directory `images/`
 * contains `spam.png` and `eggs.jpeg`.
 *
 * For security reasons, paths within the virtual filesystem are non-writable by default, unless they are within an
 * optional specified write directory. The write directory may exist at any writable physical path, but it will always
 * be attached at `/write/` in the virtual filesystem. Note that if the write directory doesn't exist when this
 * ResourceManager is initialized, it will be created, along with any directories containing it, if necessary.
 *
 * @param directories A list of [[FileHandle]] into the directories to be fused into the top level roots of the virtual
 *                    filesystem.
 * @param writeDir An optional [[FileHandle]] into the specified write directory. The write directory's virtual path will be
 *                 set to `/write/`.
 * @param order A [[LoadOrderPolicy]] representing the game's load-order
 *               policy.
